Code for the paper "DLAB -  Deep learning methods for structure-based virtual screening of antibodies"

# Install
Install libmolgrid[1] by building from source according to the instructions on the authors github [repository]{https://github.com/gnina/libmolgrid}. Use the source code provided in this repository, as a small change was made to accomodate the centering method employed for DLAB.
